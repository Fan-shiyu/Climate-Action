# Climate Analysis and Visualization

This project explores climate change, it is a combination of data analysis and visualization.  
The goal is to make climate patterns easier to see and understand, both globally and regionally.  

It is divided into two parts:

- Part 1 focuses on global climate trends
- Part 2 focuses on extreme weather patterns in China 

### Part 1: Global Climate
- Studied annual anomalies in global ocean surface temperature from 1880 to 2021  
- Analyzed historical carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (1750–2020)  
- Worked with global surface temperature datasets to see long-term climate trends  
- Created clear visualizations to show how temperatures and emissions have changed over time  

### Part 2: China – Rainfall and Temperature
- Collected rainfall data (2010–2021) and visualized it using violin plots
- Analyzed temperature distributions and created visualizations of changes over the years 
- Studied the relationship between temperature factors and warnings 
- Produced charts to make climate variations in China easier to understand
